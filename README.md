### Overview ###
In this assignment, we create a 3D Ping Pong game. The game serves a ball whenever SPACEBAR is pressed. The score is kept at the upper right corner. The game will detect when the ball hits the table, the user's paddle or the net. We simulate real projectile motion and the effect of gravity. The game starts with an initial ball launch; with every subsequent collision, we "re-launch" the ball with new position coordinates. This strategy achieves a very realistic approximation of what happens for each particular type of collision.
